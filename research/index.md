## Theme

### Our research focus in the integration of computer science and biology. Here, we repurpose, apply and develop (when needed) algorithms to complex biological data to answer critical questions in the area of immunology associated to chronical and infectious diseases.

## Liquid biopsy

### In collaboration with Dr. Dogra, we use cutting edge technology to purify exosomes and minimal sample RNA recovery to characterize the RNA profiles from liquid biopsy samples. We QC and process the sequencing data to characterize expression profiles from either known or unknown regions in the genome to identify signatures associated to different types of cancer (Primarily Prostate Cancer). We use diverse type of assays to tackle hypothesis such as RNAseq, scRNAseq, mass spectrometry.

## Cancer Research

### In collaboration with Dr. Gnjatic, we focus in understanding the intricated mechanisms behind immune response in cancer clinical trials and infectious diseases such as covid-19. We analyse diverse types of assays including RNAseq, Single cell - RNAseq, Methylation, Proteomics (Olink, Somalogics), Serology and Seromics.
