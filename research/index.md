## Theme 'Human Health'

### My research focus in integrate computer science and biology to answer basic and translational questions raised by me or my collaborators. To address critical questions in human health including chronic and infectious diseases, immunology, aging and neuroscience, we repurpose, apply, and develop algorithms to interrogate complex biological data. 

## Liquid biopsy

### In collaboration with Dr. Dogra, we use cutting edge technology to purify extracellular vesicles and particles using minimal sample RNA recovery to characterize the total RNA profiles from liquid biopsy samples. We QC and process the sequencing data to characterize expression profiles from either known or unknown regions in the genome to identify signatures associated to different types of human malignancies. We use diverse type of assays to tackle organ specific hypothesis such as RNAseq, scRNAseq, mass spectrometry.

## Cancer Research

### In collaboration with Dr. Gnjatic, we focus in understanding the intricated mechanisms behind immune response in cancer clinical trials and infectious diseases such as covid-19. We dissect diverse types of assays including RNAseq, Single cell - RNAseq, Methylation, Proteomics (Olink, Somalogics), Serology, Seromics, multiplex immuno histochemistry and spatial transcriptomics or proteomics.
