## Applied Computational Biology and Biostatistics Laboratory

I'm an Assistant Professor part of the [Oncological Sciences Department](https://icahn.mssm.edu/about/departments/oncological-sciences) in the [Icahn School of Medicine](https://icahn.mssm.edu/).

I work together with other Professors (Drs. Gnjatic and Dogra) to identify the molecular mechanisms behind cellular and immunological signaling in chronic and infectious diseases. Our research specializes in applying computer science algorithms to answer biological questions in complex multi-OMICs datasets (RNAseq, Proteomics, Epigenetics and, Genomics), and immuno-monitoring in various diseases, such as cancer (various types) and covid19.
