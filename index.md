# Welcome to my Website!

I'm a postdoc part of the [Genetics and Genomics Department](https://icahn.mssm.edu/research/genomics?page_id=13) in the [Icahn School of Medicine](https://icahn.mssm.edu/).

The long-term goal of our lab is to identify the molecular mechanisms behind cell communication and immune signaling in chronic and infectious diseases. Our research specializes in applying computer science algorithms to elucidate biological questions in complex multi-OMICs datasets, and immuno-monitoring in various diseases, such as cancer (various types) and covid19.
