## Computational Biology Laboratory

I'm an Assistant Professor part of the [Immunology and Immunotherapy Department](https://icahn.mssm.edu/about/departments-offices/immunology-immunotherapy) in the [Icahn School of Medicine](https://icahn.mssm.edu/). 

My long-term goal is to expand our understanding of how homeostasis becomes dysregulated using integrative multi-OMIC approaches and liquid biopsies.

I work together with other investigators to identify the molecular mechanisms behind cellular and immunological signaling in chronic and infectious diseases. Our research specializes in applying and developing computer science algorithms to answer biological questions in complex multi-OMICs datasets (RNAseq, Proteomics, Epigenetics and, Genomics), and immuno-monitoring in a multitude of human diseases.
